              <h3>Septic Information for Homeowners</h3>
              <p>Septic systems are being used in 25% of all U.S. homes. Poorly managed systems have been named as a
                concern by nearly every federal and state program that deals with water resource issues. According to
                various reports and studies, an estimated 10% to 20% of septic systems fail each year. <br> <br>
                Septic systems treat and disperse relatively small volumes of wastewater from individual or small
                numbers of homes and commercial buildings. Septic system regulation is usually a state, tribal, and
                local responsibility. EPA provides information to homeowners and assistance to state and local
                governments to improve the management of septic systems to prevent failures that could harm human health
                and water quality. <br> <br>
                Some septic systems are regulated by EPA if they receive industrial or commercial wastes and/or they
                have the capacity to serve 20 or more people. More information about septic systems regulated by EPA. If
                your septic tank failed, or you know someone who did, you are not alone. As a homeowner, you are
                responsible for maintaining your septic system. Proper septic system maintenance will help keep your
                system from failing and will help maintain your investment in your home. Failing septic systems can
                contaminate the ground water that you or your neighbors drink and can pollute nearby rivers, lakes and
                coastal waters.
              </p>

                  porro magni qui necessitatibus dolorem at animi cupiditate.</p> -->

              <p class="mt-3">Here are ten simple steps you can take to keep your septic system working properly.</p>

              <ul>
                <li>Locate your septic tank and drainfield. Keep a drawing of these locations in your records. </li>
                <li>Have your septic system inspected at least every three years. </li>
                <li>Pump your septic tank as needed (generally every three to five years). </li>
                <li>Don't dispose of household hazardous wastes in sinks or toilets. </li>
                <li>Keep other household items, such as dental floss, feminine hygiene products, condoms, diapers, and
                  cat litter out of your system. </li>
                <li>Use water efficiently. </li>
                <li>Plant only grass over and near your septic system. Roots from nearby trees or shrubs might clog and
                  damage the system. Also, do not apply manure or fertilizers over the drainfield. </li>
                <li>Keep vehicles and livestock off your septic system. The weight can damage the pipes and tank, and
                  your system may not drain properly under compacted soil.</li>
                <li>Keep gutters and basement sump pumps from draining into or near your septic system.</li>
                <li>Check with your local health department before using additives. Commercial septic tank additives do
                  not eliminate the need for periodic pumping and can be harmful to your system. </li>

                  Septic systems are used to treat and dispose of relatively small volumes of wastewater, usually from
                  houses and businesses that are located relatively close together. Septic systems are also called
                  onsite wastewater treatment systems, decentralized wastewater treatment systems, ON-lot systems,
                  individual sewage disposal systems, CLUSTER systems, PACKAGE plants, AND PRIVATE sewage systems.
                </p>

              <div class="tab-pane fade show" id="tab-2">
                <span class="septic-tabs-br"><br><br></span>
                <p>
                  Because septic systems do not involve central wastewater collection and treatment, they are considered
                  decentralized.
                </p>

              </div>

                <p>
                  Most septic system failures are related to inappropriate design and poor maintenance. Some soil-based
                  systems (with a leach or drain field) have been installed at sites with inadequate or inappropriate
                  soils, excessive slopes or high ground water tables. These conditions can cause hydraulic failures and
                  water resource contamination. Failure to perform routine maintenance, such as pumping the septic tank
                  at least every 3 to 5 years, can cause solids in the tank to migrate into the drain field and clog the
                  system.
                </p>

              </div>

              <div class="tab-pane fade show " id="tab-4">

                <p>
                  The typical septic treatment system includes a septic tank, which digests organic matter and separates
                  floatable matter (e.g., oils and grease) and settleable solids from the wastewater. Soil-based systems
                  discharge the liquid (effluent) from the septic tank into a series of perforated pipes buried in a
                  leach field, leaching chambers, or other special units designed to slowly release the effluent into
                  the soil or surface water.
                  Alternative systems USE pumps OR gravity TO help septic tank effluent trickle through sand, organic
                  matter (e.g., peat, sawdust), constructed wetlands, OR other media TO remove OR neutralize pollutants
                  LIKE disease-causing pathogens, nitrogen, phosphorus, AND other contaminants. SOME alternative systems
                  are designed TO evaporate wastewater OR disinfect it before it IS discharged TO the soil OR surface
                  waters.

                  If sewage from your plumbing fixtures or onsite system backs up into your basement, avoid contact with
                  the sewage and the possibly harmful pathogens it might contain. Contact your local health department
                  or regulatory agency. Cleanup personnel should wear protective clothing (e.g., long rubber gloves,
                  face splash shields). After cleanup is complete, all equipment, tools, and clothing used in the
                  cleanup and the flooded basement area should be washed thoroughly and disinfected with a mixture of 90
                  percent water and 10 percent household bleach. The area should be dried out with fans, heat lamps, or
                  other devices and not be used until it has been completely dry for at least 24 hours.

                  Septic systems that are properly planned, designed, sited, installed, operated and maintained can
                  provide excellent wastewater treatment. However, systems that are sited in densities that exceed the
                  treatment capacity of regional soils and systems that are poorly designed, installed, operated or
                  maintained can cause problems. The most serious documented problems involve contamination of surface
                  waters and ground water with disease-causing pathogens and nitrates. Other problems include excessive
                  nitrogen discharges to sensitive coastal waters and phosphorus pollution of inland surface waters,
                  which increases algal growth and lowers dissolved oxygen levels. Contamination of important shellfish
                  beds and swimming beaches by pathogens is also a concern in some coastal regions. EPA has developed
                  Guidelines to assist communities in establishing comprehensive management programs for septic
                  wastewater systems to improve water quality and protect public health.

                  Septic systems serve approximately 25 percent of the U.S. population and about 40 percent of new
                  developments. The U.S. Census Bureau has indicated that at least 10 percent of septic systems have
                  stopped working. Some communities report failure rates as high as 70 percent! State agencies report
                  that these failing systems are the third most common source of ground water contamination. In EPA's
                  1997 Response to Congress on Use of Decentralized Wastewater Treatment Systems, the Agency determined
                  that with the technology now available, adequately managed decentralized systems can protect public
                  health and the environment as well as provide long-term solutions for the nation's wastewater needs.
                  The report also cited five major barriers to increasing the use of decentralized wastewater treatment
                  systems, and one barrier is the lack of adequate management.

                  In most states, local health departments issue construction and operating permits to install septic
                  systems under state laws that govern public health protection and abatement of public nuisances. Some
                  states are beginning to add water resource protection provisions to their septic system regulations
                  because of the possible impacts from nitrogen and phosphorus. Under most regulatory programs, the
                  local permitting agency conducts a site assessment to determine whether the soils present can provide
                  adequate treatment, to ensure that ground water resources will not be threatened, and to stipulate
                  appropriate setback distances from buildings, driveways, property lines and surface waters. Some
                  states permit alternative systems if conventional soil-based systems are not allowable. Very few
                  permitting agencies conduct regular inspections of septic systems after they are installed.

                  EPA is partnering with federal agencies, states, tribes, local governments and nongovernmental
                  organizations TO improve the MANAGEMENT OF septic systems. EPA’s Guidelines FOR managing decentralized
                  wastewater treatment systems can be tailored TO meet the needs OF states, counties, tribes, cities,
                  towns, subdivisions AND other areas WHERE septic systems might threaten PUBLIC health OR water
                  resources. The Guidelines focus ON the following areas WHERE better MANAGEMENT can achieve significant
                  improvements IN overall SYSTEM performance:

                  No. The adoption of the Guidelines is voluntary. EPA recognizes that states, tribes and local
                  governments need a flexible framework so they can tailor their programs to the needs of the community.
                  The Guidelines are not intended to supersede existing federal, state, tribal, and local laws and
                  regulations.

                  Office of Research and Development; EPA regional offices; and the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
                  Significant input was received from numerous stakeholders, state health agencies, environmental
                  groups, and national organizations. See the Partners page for a complete list.

                  The Guidelines are presented in the form of five model management programs. Each model program
                  includes the elements and activities needed to achieve certain management objectives. The Guidelines
                  address the sensitivity of the environment in the community and the complexity of the system used. The

                  also help states, tribes AND communities TO develop, MODIFY AND implement laws AND regulations IN the
                  area OF MANAGEMENT planning FOR decentralized wastewater systems.

                  According to the U.S. Census Bureau, about 26 million homes (one-fourth of all homes) in America are
                  served by decentralized wastewater treatment systems. The Census Bureau reports that the distribution
                  and density of septic systems vary widely by region and state, from a high of about 55 percent in
                  Vermont to a low of around 10 percent in California. The New England states have the highest
                  proportion of homes served by septic systems: New Hampshire and Maine both report that about one-half
                  of all homes are served by individual systems. More than one-third of the homes in the southeastern
                  states depend on these systems, including approximately 48 percent in North Carolina and about 40
                  percent in both Kentucky and South Carolina. More than 60 million people in the nation are served by
                  septic systems. About one-third of all new development is served by septic or other decentralized
                  treatment systems.
