                EPA regulates public water systems; it does not have the authority to regulate private drinking water
                wells. Approximately 15 percent of Americans rely on their own private drinking water supplies, and
                these supplies are not subject to EPA standards, although some state and local governments do set rules
                to protect users of these wells. Unlike public drinking water systems serving many people, they do not
                have experts regularly checking the water’s source and its quality before it is sent to the tap. These
                households must take special precautions to ensure the protection and maintenance of their drinking
                water supplies.

                There are three types of private drinking water wells: dug, driven, and drilled. See the three links
                below for an explanation and graphic of the types of wells.

              </ul>

              <p class="mt-3">
                Proper well construction and continued maintenance are keys to the safety of your water supply. Your
                state water-well contractor licensing agency, local health department, or local water system
                professional can provide information on well construction. <br>
                The well should be located so rainwater flows away from it. Rainwater can pick up harmful bacteria and
                chemicals on the land’s surface. If this water pools near your well, it can seep into it, potentially
                causing health problems.
              </p>

              <p class="mt-3">
                Water-well drillers and pump-well installers are listed in your local phone directory. The contractor
                should be bonded and insured. Make certain your ground water contractor is registered or licensed in
                your state, if required. If your state does not have a licensing/registration program contact the
                National Ground Water Association. They have a voluntary certification program for contractors. (In
                fact, some states use the Association’s exams as their test for licensing.) For a list of certified
                contractors in your state contact the Association at (614) 898-7791 or (800) 551-7379. There is no cost
                for mailing or faxing the list to you. <br><br>
                To keep your well safe, you must be sure possible sources of contamination are not close by. Experts
                suggest the following distances as a minimum for protection — farther is better (see graphic on the
                right):
              </p>

              </ul>


              <p>
                Many homeowners tend to forget the value of good maintenance until problems reach crisis levels. That
                can be expensive. It’s better to maintain your well, find problems early, and correct them to protect
                your well’s performance. Keep up-to-date records of well installation and repairs plus pumping and water
                tests. Such records can help spot changes and possible problems with your water system. If you have
                problems, ask a local expert to check your well construction and maintenance records. He or she can see
                if your system is okay or needs work. <br><br>
                Protect your own well area. Be careful about storage and disposal of household and lawn care chemicals
                and wastes. Good farmers and gardeners minimize the use of fertilizers and pesticides. Take steps to
                reduce erosion and prevent surface water runoff. Regularly check underground storage tanks that hold
                home heating oil, diesel, or gasoline. Make sure your well is protected from the wastes of livestock,
                pets, and wildlife.

                    <p>Dug wells are holes in the ground dug by shovel or backhoe. Historically, a dug well was
                      excavated below the groundwater table until incoming water exceeded the digger’s bailing rate. The
                      well was then lined (cased) with stones, brick, tile, or other material to prevent collapse. It
                      was covered with a cap of wood, stone, or concrete. Since it is so difficult to dig beneath the
                      ground water table, dug wells are not very deep. Typically, they are only 10 to 30 feet deep.
                      Being so shallow, dug wells have the highest risk of becoming contaminated.To minimize the
                      likelihood of contamination, your dug well should have certain features. These features help to
                      prevent contaminants from traveling along the outside of the casing or through the casing and into
                      the well.</p>

                    <ul class="mt-3">
                      <li class="mt-1">The well should be cased with a watertight material (for example,
                        tongue-and-groove precast
                        concrete) and a cement grout or bentoniteclay sealant poured along the outside of the casing to
                        the top of the well.
                      </li>
                      <li class="mt-1">The well should be covered by a concrete curband cap that stands about a foot
                        above the
                        ground.
                      </li>
                      <li class="mt-1">The land surface around the well should be mounded so that surface water runs
                        away from the

                      <br><br> While dug wells
                      have been used as a household water supply source for
                      many years, most are &#8220;relics&#8221; of older homes, dug before drilling equipment was
                      readily
                      available or when drilling was considered too expensive.
                      If you have a dug well on your property and are using it for drinking water, check to make sure it
                      is properly covered and sealed. Another problem relating to the shallowness of a dug well is that
                      it
                      may go dry during a drought when the ground water table drops.

                    <h4 class="card-title">Driven Wells</h4>
                    <p>Like dug wells, driven wells pull water from the water-saturated zone above the bedrock. Driven
                      wells can be deeper than dug wells. They are typically 30 to 50 feet deep and are usually located
                      in areas with thick sand and gravel deposits where the ground water table is within 15 feet of the
                      ground’s surface. In the proper geologic setting, driven wells can be easy and relatively
                      inexpensive to install. <br>
                      Although deeper than dug wells, driven wells are still relatively shallow and have a
                      moderate-to-high risk of contamination from nearby land activities. </p>

                    <strong>Driven Well Construction Features</strong>

                    <ul class="mt-3">
                      <li class="mt-1">Assembled lengths of two inches to three inches diameter metal pipes are driven
                        into the
                        ground.
                        Ascreened &#8220;well point&#8221; located at the end of the pipe helps drive the pipe through
                        the sand and gravel. The screen allows water to enter the well and filters out sediment.
                      </li>
                      <li class="mt-1">The pump for the well is in one of two places: on top ofthe well or in the house.
                        An access
                        pit
                        is usually dug around the well down to the frost line and a water discharge pipe to the house is
                        joined to the well pipe with a fitting.
                      </li>
                      <li class="mt-1">The well and pit are capped with the same kind of large-diameter concrete tile
                        used for a dug
                        well. The access pit may be cased with pre-cast concrete.
                      </li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>
                      To minimize this risk, the well cover should be a tight-fitting concrete curb and cap with no
                      cracks and should sit about a foot above the ground. Slope the ground away from the well so that
                      surface water will not pond around the well. If there’s a pit above the well, either to hold the
                      pump or to access the fitting, you may also be able to pour a grout sealant along the outside of
                      the well pipe. Protecting the water quality requires that you maintain proper well construction
                      and monitor your activities around the well. It is also important to follow the same land use
                      precautions around the driven well as described under dug wells.

                    <h4 class="card-title">Drilled Wells</h4>
                    <p>Drilled wells penetrate about 100-400 feet into the bedrock. Where you find bedrock at the
                      surface, it is commonly called ledge. To serve as a water supply, a drilled well must intersect
                      bedrock fractures containing ground water. </p>

                    <br>
                    <strong class="">Drilled Well Construction Features</strong>

                    <ul class="mt-3">

                      <li class="mt-1">The casing is usually metal or plastic pipe, six inches in diameter
                        that extends into the bedrock to prevent shallow ground water from entering
                        the well. By law, the casing has to extend at least 18 feet into the
                        ground, with at least five feet extending into the bedrock. The casing
                        should also extend a foot or two above the ground&#8217;s surface. A
                        sealant, such as cement grout or bentonite clay, should be poured along
                        the outside of the casing to the top of the well. The well is capped
                        to prevent surface water from entering the well.
                      </li>

                      <li class="mt-1">Submersible pumps, located near the bottom of the well, are most commonly
                        used in drilled wells. Wells with a shallow water table may feature
                        a jet pump located inside the home. Pumps require special wiring and
                        electrical service. Well pumps should be installed and serviced by a
                        qualified professional registered with your state.
                      </li>

                      <li class="mt-1">Most modern drilled wells incorporate a pitless adapter designed to
                        provide a sanitary seal at the point where the discharge water line
                        leaves the well to enter your home. The device attaches directly to
                        the casing below the frost line and provides a watertight subsurface
                        connection, protecting the well from frost and contamination.
                      </li>

                      <li class="mt-1">Older drilled wells may lack some of these sanitary features. The
                        well pipe used was oftene ight-, 10- or 12- inches in diameter, and
                        covered with a concrete well cap either at or below the ground&#8217;s surface. This outmoded
                        type of construction does not provide the same degree of protection from surface contamination.
                        Also, older wells may not have a pitless adapter to provide a seal at the point of discharge
                        from the well.
                      </li>

                National Secondary Drinking Water Regulations (NSDWRs or secondary standards) are non-enforceable
                guidelines regulating contaminants that may cause cosmetic effects (such as skin or tooth discoloration)
                or aesthetic effects (such as taste, odor, or color) in drinking water. EPA recommends secondary
                standards to water systems but does not require systems to comply. However, states may choose to adopt
                them as enforceable standards.
